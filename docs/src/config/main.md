# Configuration

Chariot uses a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to describe its configuration. Configuration is typically stored in files with the `.chariot` extension (for example, `config.chariot`).

The elysium distro repo contains a set of recipes that can be used as a reference <https://github.com/elysium-os/elysium>.
